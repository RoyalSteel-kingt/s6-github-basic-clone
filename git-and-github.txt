Before the master branch was the main branch, but it had to be change
due to concern about the naming scheme.
Whenever you branch out from the main branch, you're able to mess around
with new things quickly and be able to destory or keep those changes
without messing with the main branch.
There's two major steps (add and commit) that is always in use to fully
save progress with the git. Though, even if they're set in stone...
they're can be either restore, reset or reverted back to the first commit/change.
=======
GitHub can be run through the cloud and has options to either clone
the repo to the localized computer or push from the local computer
into the cloud.
Due to be also being in the cloud, it's also able to be shared, downloaded and
worked on with other people who are interested in the project.
Whenever you make a repo, you can also request a README file, 
an .gigingnore file and what licenese does this project have.
